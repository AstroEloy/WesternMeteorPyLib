""" Run MetSimErosion back up a solved trajectory from its reference point, to before it was observed, and give
    where it ended in the trajectory solver's ECI frame, ready for wmpl.Rebound.REBOUND.reboundSimulate().

    state_vect = np.r_[traj.state_vect_mini, traj.v_init*traj.radiant_eci_mini]
    jd, state_vects, masses = backwardStates(traj.jdt_ref, [state_vect] + realizations, m_init)

From the command line, to a height or for a time, with or without Monte Carlo realizations:

    python -m wmpl.MetSim.BackwardAtmIntegration traj.pickle --mass 0.5 --atm_height 180 --mc 100

State vectors are [x, y, z, vx, vy, vz] in ECI (true equator and equinox of date), in m and m/s, with the
velocity pointing to the radiant, as the solver gives them and reboundSimulate() takes them.

The run follows a single body, whose mass grows back as dm = sigma m v dv. MetSim erodes the body with the same law
as it ablates it, so its erosion is undone by giving the effective coefficient sigma + eta: only the eroded grains,
which are not followed, cannot be undone. The coefficient is the effective one between the starting point and where
the run ends, which nothing observed measures. An apparent coefficient fitted to the meteoroid's deceleration (e.g.
by DynamicMassFit, AlphaBeta or the trajectory solver's --vinitdrag over all its points) includes its erosion, but
over the observed part, lower down: where the erosion or fragmentation grows with the dynamic pressure, it is larger
there than above, so taking it overestimates the mass growth. The same holds for Ceplecha et al. (1998)'s 0.014,
0.042, 0.10 and 0.21 s^2/km^2 for fireball types I, II, IIIA and IIIB, apparent coefficients over whole trajectories
including their gross fragmentation; single bright meteors range from 0.001 to 0.19 s^2/km^2 (Silber et al. 2015).
It matters when the run starts deep. Run back to 180 km, the speed there relative to a run with a frozen mass, and
the mass there over the starting one, were, for sigma = 0.023 and sigma + eta = 0.123 and 0.323 s^2/km^2:

| Start | Speed change (m/s) | Mass ratio |
|---|---|---|
| 1 g at 30 km/s from 100 km | 0.0, 0.0, -0.1 | 1.01, 1.03, 1.09 |
| 1 kg at 20 km/s from 70 km | -0.4, -2.3, -5.7 | 1.04, 1.2, 1.6 |
| 1 kg at 15 km/s from 60 km, 60 deg from the zenith | -8, -37, -81 | 1.14, 1.9, 4.2 |
| 1 kg at 20 km/s from 50 km | -129, -455, -730 | 1.8, 9.8, 62 |

What matters most is whether the body was already eroding just above the first point. With eta = 0.3 s^2/km^2 only
up to some height above the start, and sigma = 0.023 above it, the share of the speed change that eroding all the
way up gives, from the run without erosion, and the mass at 180 km over the starting one were:

| Eroding up to | 15 km/s from 60 km | 20 km/s from 50 km |
|---|---|---|
| 0.5 km above | 18%, 1.27 | 26%, 2.6 |
| 1 km above | 32%, 1.40 | 44%, 3.6 |
| 2 km above | 53%, 1.65 | 66%, 6.1 |
| 5 km above | 84%, 2.37 | 90%, 15.9 |
| 10 km above | 97%, 3.23 | 98%, 33.7 |
| 180 km | 100% (-73 m/s), 4.15 | 100% (-601 m/s), 61.9 |

The speed is set within the first few km, while the mass keeps growing with any erosion higher up.

Against a truth run forwards from 180 km (chondritic fireballs of 10 kg at 15, 20 and 30 km/s, intrinsic sigma =
0.005 s^2/km^2, eta = 0.1-0.3 s^2/km^2 starting where the dynamic pressure reaches 0.04 MPa or the received energy 1
MJ/m^2, the same atmosphere in every run, reference points at 50-70 km), running back with the right sigma + eta all
the way to 180 km left the speed within 3 m/s and the mass within a factor 1.3, over the truth when the erosion had
started at 0.04 MPa; going back to the intrinsic sigma above either onset gave the speed within 4 m/s and the mass
within a factor 0.73-1.3. A height above which the body stops eroding is therefore not modelled: the thin air there
takes little speed. What sets the result is sigma + eta over the first few km above the reference point. Run back
with the intrinsic sigma or MetSim's 0.023 instead, the speed came out up to 2 m/s off from 70 km, 73 m/s from 60 km
and 660 m/s from 50 km; for a body that did not erode, MetSim's 0.023 put it 7-24 m/s low from 50 km. A
fragmentation above the reference point cannot be undone: with half the mass lost at 0.04 or 0.12 MPa and the right
coefficient, the mass at 180 km came out half the true one and the speed 5-17 or 17-58 m/s high.

So the command lines report the dynamic pressure and the energy received at the reference point (referenceLoading),
warn when the pressure is over the 0.04 MPa of the first fragmentation of chondritic fireballs
(FIRST_FRAGMENTATION_PRESSURE), and report the nominal run with the coefficients of Ceplecha's types I and IIIB, as
a warning when the two speeds differ by more than the uncertainty of the initial velocity. When the coefficient is
uncertain, --ablation_coeff_sigma draws one for each Monte Carlo realization.
