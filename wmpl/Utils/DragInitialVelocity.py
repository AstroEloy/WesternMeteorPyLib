""" Initial velocity of a decelerating meteor from a fit of a single-body drag and ablation model to the lengths
    along the first part of its trajectory.

The trajectory solver estimates the initial velocity as the slope of a straight line fitted to the first part
of the meteor (at least the first 25% of the points). A meteor that already decelerates there is slower on
average over that part than at its first point, so the slope underestimates the velocity at the reference
point. For a fireball first seen at 45-60 km this can be hundreds of m/s, comparable to or larger than the
deceleration in the atmosphere above the first point, and it carries into the orbit.

Here the lengths of the points within a time from the first one (1 s by default), and optionally above a height,
are fitted with a MetSim single body, in 3D with gravity and the Coriolis acceleration:
dv/dt = -B rho(h) v^2 (m0/m)^(1/3) plus gravity, where rho is the atmosphere density and the mass ablates at the
rate set by sigma, as m/m0 = exp(sigma (v^2 - v0^2)/2) without gravity. The fitted parameters are the velocity at
t = 0, sigma and B = Gamma A rho_m^(-2/3) m0^(-1/3), so neither the mass nor the bulk density are needed: MetSim's
drag only takes that combination, and the mass it is given follows from B. The measured deceleration constrains B
and sigma, and with them the velocity at the first point. The time offsets of the stations other than the
reference one are fitted again, since the solver estimates them with a lag model that absorbs part of the
deceleration; they are only used for this fit.

With the option on, the solver takes the fitted velocity whenever the fit converges and fits better than the
straight line. Keeping the straight line when the fit does not measure its bias (when the two velocities are within
sqrt(2) of the fit's uncertainty) was tried and dropped: it rests on the straight line being the more precise, but
the solver's straight-line uncertainty is formal: through the solver, on the synthetic meteoroids below, where that
rule kept the straight line its errors were 5-10 times that uncertainty in RMS. On 26 synthetic meteoroids (12-65
km/s, B from 1e-6 to 1.5e-2 m^2/kg, sigma 0.005-0.03 s^2/km^2, first seen at 55-115 km, two noise realizations each,
52 runs), the RMS velocity error was 195 and 251 m/s for the straight line, 15 and 23 m/s for the drag fit, and 20
and 27 m/s with that rule (the first 10 meteoroids, then 16 others); no threshold for it did consistently better
than none. Even where it kept the straight line, the drag fit's RMS error was smaller (14 against 21 and 20 against
29 m/s), and its own uncertainty was calibrated (RMS of the error over it 0.87 and 0.99). With the option off,
estimateLineBias() fits a parabola to the straight line's points and the solver warns when it puts the velocity at
the first point more than 2 sigma above the straight line's. On the 16 meteoroids not used to set that threshold (32
runs), it warned for 7 of the 10 straight lines over 100 m/s low, 1 of the 5 that were 50-100 m/s low, and 1 of the
17 within 50 m/s (that one 5 m/s low); its precision falls with the speed: it did not warn for any of the four
straight lines 60-172 m/s low above 35 km/s. Neither check sees a fragmentation or a wake (below).

In the solver's Monte Carlo the fit is redone for each realization, so the spread of the initial velocity, and of
the orbit, includes it. For the fireball at 24 km/s first seen at 60 km, with 30 realizations (geometric
uncertainties, 8 cores), every realization used the fit, each took 2.0 s against 1.5 s without it, and their
velocities were 0.4 m/s off on average with a spread of 29 m/s, against a formal uncertainty of the nominal fit of
34 m/s; without the option the realizations were 614 m/s low with a spread of 10 m/s, so the Monte Carlo uncertainty
of the straight line does not include its bias.

MetSim erodes mass with the same law as it ablates it, so the erosion of the main body is absorbed by the fitted
sigma, which is then sigma + eta; the eroded grains are not followed. On the true lengths of the main body of the
MetSim erosion model, integrated with 0.1 ms steps, with 10 m of noise and ten noise realizations (20 km/s and 1 kg
first seen at 70 km, 30 km/s and 0.1 kg first seen at 80 km), erosion with eta = 0.1-0.3 s^2/km^2 from above the
first point or starting 3-8 km below it, or changing from 0.05 to 0.5 s^2/km^2 5 km below it, so active over most of
the fitted points, did not bias the velocity: over 170 distinct fits of 1 s or of all points, its error over its
uncertainty had a mean of -0.05, and it differed from the error of the same meteoroid without erosion, over the same
points and noise, by +0.28 of the uncertainty on average and by at most 3.0. Strong erosion makes the uncertainty
somewhat too small: the RMS of the error over the uncertainty was 1.18, and 1.23 with eta = 0.3, against 1.00
without erosion over the same points, with 88% of the fits within 2 sigma against 94%. The fitted sigma was sigma +
eta when the points cover enough of the deceleration, e.g. 0.105 and 0.30 s^2/km^2 for eta = 0.1 and 0.3 at 20 km/s
fitting all points, but 0.18-0.23 for 0.31 over the shorter spans at 30 km/s. Over 1 s sigma is often poorly
constrained: without erosion it ended at one of its bounds in 9-10 of 20 fits, while the velocity uncertainty stayed
calibrated (RMS of the error over it 0.91-1.01), so sigma does not flag the problems below. All these tests use
MetSim both as the truth and as the model: they show the fit absorbs MetSim's erosion of the body, not that a real
meteoroid erodes that way.

A fragmentation is not described, and the fit does not detect it: its RMS stays below the straight line's. Erosion
that starts within the fitted part, after a stretch without it, acts alike. In synthetic tests (20 and 30 km/s,
first seen at 55 and 70 km), the main body losing 50-80% of its mass 10-20 km below the first point biased the
velocity by 40-480 m/s, 5-29 times its uncertainty. With erosion of eta = 0.1 s^2/km^2 starting 10 km below the
first point (truth integrated with 0.1 ms steps, ten noise realizations), fitting all points biased it by -357 m/s,
20 times its uncertainty, for 20 km/s and 1 kg first seen at 55 km and fitted down to 40 km, and by 16 m/s below the
same fit without erosion, 3 times its uncertainty, first seen at 70 km and fitted down to 46 km. The 1 s fits, which
ended within 4.5 km below the start of the erosion, had a mean error over their uncertainty of -0.1 to -0.8 in all
eight cases (eta = 0.1 and 0.3, 20 and 30 km/s, first seen at 55 and 70 km). Fitting only the points above a
fragmentation, all were within their uncertainty. Hence the fitted part ends at a time or a height, which should be
before the first fragmentation, e.g. from the light curve. Without fragmentation, on the true lengths of 35
synthetic meteoroids, the uncertainty of the velocity had a median of 97, 33 and 9 m/s fitting 0.5 s, 1 s and all
points.

The fit therefore reports, along its model over the fitted points, the dynamic pressure rho_air v^2 and the energy
received per unit cross section from the top of the atmosphere, E = int rho_air v^3/2 dt, and notes (breakupNotes)
when the fitted part crosses the 0.04-0.12 or 0.5-5 MPa of the first and second fragmentation phases of ordinary
chondritic fireballs (Borovicka et al. 2020), with the height where it reaches 0.04 MPa, or the 1-2 MJ/m^2 at which
the erosion of cometary shower meteoroids observed by CAMO begins (Buccongello et al. 2024). These only point to the
light curve: Geminids begin to crumble at 1-100 kPa (Henych et al. 2024), and the strength of a given meteoroid can
be far from them. In the test cases, a fireball at 24 km/s first seen at 75 km crosses 0.04 MPa at 70 km, one first
seen at 60 km is already at 0.17 MPa and reaches 1 MPa, and a meteor at 30 km/s first seen at 115 km receives
0.2-6.7 MJ/m^2. Through NRLMSISE-00 at 45 deg from the zenith, 1-2 MJ/m^2 are received by 90-94 km at 12 km/s,
96-100 km at 20 km/s, 100-105 km at 30 km/s and 111-117 km at 70 km/s, close to the erosion onset heights CAMO fits
find. So for a meteoroid first seen below about 90 km, the energy criterion puts any erosion before the first point,
active over the whole fitted part, which the fit absorbs; a fragmentation triggered by pressure is the likelier
break within it.

The lengths must follow the body. The solver measures the centroid of the light, which with erosion includes the
wake of the grains slowing down behind the body as they ablate. The fit takes the change of that lag for
deceleration, and neither its uncertainty nor its RMS show it. How large the bias is depends on how the centroid is
measured and on the grains, so the numbers here are from one synthetic model of the measurement, and give its order
and that it can have either sign, not the bias of a given camera: the luminosity-weighted centroid of the body and
of all the grains within 1 km behind it, with no point spread function, saturation or detection threshold, a
constant luminous efficiency, grain masses chosen for the test, and the same two meteoroids integrated with 0.5 ms
steps. Fitting 1 s, eta = 0.1 s^2/km^2 at 30 km/s moved the velocity by about 25 m/s (1 sigma) from the same fit
without erosion with grains of 1e-9 to 1e-7 kg, while the straight line was 465 m/s low, but by 230-280 m/s with
grains of 1e-7 to 1e-5 and 1e-6 to 1e-4 kg; at 20 km/s with grains of 1e-6 to 1e-4 kg the velocity was 400 m/s low,
21-26 times its uncertainty. With the larger grains the errors ranged from -470 to +185 m/s, of either sign
depending on where the erosion started, and the fit was sometimes further off than the straight line. For a grain
that keeps its speed, the lag when it is consumed goes as m^(1/3)/(sigma^2 rho_air v^4), so the wake is longest for
large grains, thin air and slow meteors. If the meteor shows a significant wake within the point spread function,
the fitted velocity should not be trusted; data that follow the leading fragment, as high-resolution tracking does,
are not affected.

Two checks can reveal a wake, neither reliably. In the same model, with two stations whose centroids take 100 m and
1000 m of the wake (a stand-in for different ranges or plate scales), fits of 1 s and of all points and three noise
realizations: fitting each station alone and comparing their velocities flagged (over 3 sigma) 15 of the 31 biased
events and none of the 17 unbiased ones; the mass implied by B, (Gamma A rho_m^(-2/3)/B)^3, outside 0.1-10 times the
true mass flagged 16 of the 31 and 2 of the 17; either, 25 of the 31. The misses were fits of all points 28-110 m/s
off. These rates are optimistic: the 0.1-10 band was chosen after seeing the fits, and the implied mass used the
true Gamma A and bulk density, which enters it squared. Over 1 s, B is poorly constrained even without a wake
(implied mass 0.3-8 times the true one), so against a photometric mass this check only flags gross cases.

Fitting all the points of 50 synthetic meteoroids without fragmentation (15-40 km/s, B from 1.1e-3 to 2.5e-2
m^2/kg, sigma from 0.005 to 0.05 s^2/km^2, first seen at 50 and 70 km, observed while they keep 1e-3 of their mass
and 40% of their speed, with NRLMSISE-00 as the atmosphere) the velocity error over its formal uncertainty had an
RMS of 1.02 and stayed within 2.7. The fitted velocity depends on the shape of the density profile with height,
not on its scale, which B absorbs: in those cases a density 6% higher at 40 km than NRLMSISE-00, growing linearly
from 60 km, moved the velocity by up to 42 m/s, beyond 3 times its uncertainty in 6 of them. The polynomial MetSim
takes, fitted over the observed heights, was within 2.3% of NRLMSISE-00. The fit also inherits the errors of the
solver's lengths: through the solver, the synthetic fireballs of the tests come out 19-56 m/s high fitting all
their points, within 2.3 times their uncertainty.
